                            <p> - In 2014, I started a non-profit organization to donate teddy bears to children in the hospital and needed a website. 
                                I decided to learn how to build a website on my own and discovered then my passion for web development. Several years later, 
                                I built a website to house a travel blog for my cross-country travels. The following year, I created a website to turn my then physical

                            <p> - I am hardworking, reliable, and pride myself on my organizational and communicational skills. I am very goal-oriented and excel in working with a team to achieve a successful outcome while meeting deadlines.</p>
                            <p> - I would love an opportunity to tell you more about myself and answer any questions that you may have. I am actively looking for a web development position and would appreciate the opportunity to connect with you! </p>
